    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe is a must for any self-declared <em>breakfast lover</em>.
        The preparation is straight forward and allows for easy swapping of
        ingredients to appeal to all tatstes and diets (different types of milk
        and cereal offerings).<br><br>
        <strong>Be advised</strong> - while we do not condone enforcing any way to enjoy your meals,
        this recipe follows the <em>cereal first, milk after</em> serving scheme. 
        Doing these steps in the opposite order is severely frowned-upon, and can lead
        to moderate social discomfort.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Your choice of cereal (Sugary, gluten-free, etc.)</li>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Serve the desired amount of cereal in a deep bowl.<br> 
            Using a plate at this stage may look like a victimless crime,<br>
            but it <strong>will</strong> come and bite you in the rear later on.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the desired amount of milk (Do not let it overflow)</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with any optional ingredients</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
