    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        While rice can be made in a variety of ways,
        this recipe follows the traditional pot and stovetop method.<br>
        This way might take slighly longer than other alternatives,
        but it is the cheapest in terms of the rice <br> presentation you can buy. 
        It also allows to change the serving size pretty easily.
